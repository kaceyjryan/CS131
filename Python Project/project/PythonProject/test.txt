Just some test cases:

IAMAT kiwi.cs.ucla.edu +34.068930-118.445127 1400794645.392014450
WHATSAT kiwi.cs.ucla.edu 10 5

In order to test my code, run the command: twistd -n -y serverherd.py

Then open another client and telnet to port 12500 - 12504 and start sending
commands.

The log is stored in serverherd.log through the logging function of python.

Everything is implemented as the spec states although I had a little trouble
formatting the json output perfectly with manually outputting every element of
the json_data. This would be possible but not very robust and time consumingly
unnecessary so I decided against it. I'd rather leave it in the efficient
robust  manner with only the "types" portion being formatted incorrectly than
the other way around.
